# Client-Server Model ğŸ§ 
1. What is a Server?
> Is like a computer that is located in a specific location, where I can store/use the data that I need.

2. What is a Client?
> Is like the receiver from all the management in the server.

3. Is a server just another physical computer?
    - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
    > I think is because the amount of data we can store in it.
    
    - What is the difference?
    > Physical servers can be selled public but a class of a application is more like it's stay just in that place.

4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?
    - List some examples
    > Me and my refrigator, I'm the client and the fridge is the server.
    > A place (warehouse) where people can store stuff and they pay monthly for that. People are clients and server is the warehouse.

5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
    - Do desktop applications use the client-server model?
    > Yes, some of them.

    - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?
    > My MYSQL Workbench app from Microsoft, constantly can communicate to the servers to keep up to date everything.
