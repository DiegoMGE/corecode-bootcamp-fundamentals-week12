# Client-Server Model ðŸ§ 
1. What is a Server?
> Is like a computer that is located in a specific location, where I can store/use the data that I need.

2. What is a Client?
> Is like the receiver from all the management in the server.

3. Is a server just another physical computer?
    - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
    > I think is because the amount of data we can store in it.
    
    - What is the difference?
    > Physical servers can be selled public but a class of a application is more like it's stay just in that place.

4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?
    - List some examples
    > Me and my refrigator, I'm the client and the fridge is the server.
    > A place (warehouse) where people can store stuff and they pay monthly for that. People are clients and server is the warehouse.

5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
    - Do desktop applications use the client-server model?
    > Yes, some of them.

    - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?
    > My MYSQL Workbench app from Microsoft, constantly can communicate to the servers to keep up to date everything.


# HTTP Core Understanding ðŸ§ 
1. What is HTTP?
> It is like the parameter that internet needs to transfer data all over the world.

2. What is a Communication Protocol?
    > Like the "rules" to stablish the correct communication between something.

    - Do humans use communication protocols?
    > Yes, they do it.

3. What is a Request in HTTP?
> A verification that check if there are errors or requester has the permissions to access a specific web.

4. What is a Response in HTTP?
> What we get after doing a request in the browser. Can be a code that means something specific.

5. What is an HTTP method?
> Requests that the protocol make to retrieve specific information.

6. What are HTTP request headers?
> Responses that have additional information while doing a request.

# APIs Core Understanding ðŸ§ 
1. What is an API?
> Is the "tool" that brings me all the things I need.

2. What is a Protocol?
> Like rules to determinate how to process something, in this case, data.

3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?
> Not exactly.

4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?
    > Because everytime I do (first "program") something, I need an "answer" (second "program") to solve my problem.

    - Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?
    > If we talk about the idea of "communication" using the term "API", yes, we use it.

5. Is an API just another program or a standard?
> No, an API help us to have more flexibility, save us time and money.

6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?
> * API-football
> * Twitter API (until they shutting down)
> * TheMealDB API
> * GIPHY-API

# From JSON to REST ðŸ§ 
1. What is JSON?
    > Is a lightweight data-interchange format. Is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of lot of languages including of course, JavaScript.

    - Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?
    > Due that the syntax of JSON was inspired by the JavaScript Object Literal notation, so, quotes are mandatory on JSON because in JavaScript the usage of reserved words as property names is _**disallowed**_.

2. What is REST?
    > Is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

    - Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?
    > Is an architecture pattern.

3. What is a Resource in REST?
    > It a resource can be any information that can be named. If I use a GET excepting to retrieve some data, the data should be my Resource.

    - What is a resource identifier?
    > An URL.

4. How are HTTP and REST related?
    > That both have "parameters" or "rules" to work properly.

    - What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?
    > Header, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

    - Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?
    > Because we can request to retrieve, update, or manage content on a web server and methods above do that in both cases.

5. Is REST the same as HTTP?
> No, HTTP is more like a global implementation and REST is for specific cases where we use Apps with APIs.

# REST API Clients ðŸ§ 
Postman only works with REST APIs?
> No, works with GraphQL too.

Is there an alternative to Postman?
> * Testfully
> * Insomnnia
> * Thunder Client
