## Node.JS Core Understanding 🧠

1. What is Node.JS?
> Node used to execute JavaScript outside of a browser. Is perfect to build highly scalable services, real-time apps, using JavaScript everywhere. The huge advantaje of working with Node.js is that programming everything, the front-end and back-end in a single language.

- What is NPM?
> Is a manager for all node packages availables while working with JavaScript.

2. What problem does Node.JS solve (Is there any problem that can be solved with Node.JS 🤔)?
> The amount of time requests, less code but having same semantic.

3. What is the V8 Javascript Engine?
> V8 is like the "motor" (Chrome use it too), like a box, that Node uses to run all the code.

Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?
    - Why not use PHP or Golang?
> Due Node.js run with V8, it is necessary to use it in Web Development.
> Always dependes on what type of application is needed. If it's something like large network servers or complex computations, like a video rendering app, Goland is better.

4. What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?
- Are Node.JS and a browser the same?
> They are not the same, in browser we interact mostly with DOM and cookies, in Node we don't have that but instead do we have all the APIs that we can finde out through its modules.

5. What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?
> NMV is a manager to control which version of Node we want to use, that's why it is very useful for Node Developers.

## Node.JS Module System Core Understanding 🧠

1. What is a Javascript Module?
> Like a function (or file) that contains a lot of info, it can be called to execute specific tasks in larger application.

2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
> To have more practical and organized code, and of course, reusability.

3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?
> ECMASCript, CommonJS

4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?
> commonJS uses **.exports** to _export_ and **require()** to _import_ functions.
> ESModules simple use **export** to _export_ and **import** to _import_.

5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?
> 1. Core Modules
> 2. Local Modules 
> 3. Third-Party Modules

## Node.JS Hello World! 🌐
1. Why do we run the npm init command and not node init to create a new Node.JS project?
> We run **npm init** to create a new _npm package_ that will be used for our **Node.js** app.

2. When you entered the npm init command and answered the questions you saw in the terminal, a new file called packacke.json was generated.

- What does this file do?
> This file just contain all the settings for our project, from version of Node to use to message if there's an error.

- Why is this file generated?
    - The **name** element is the name of the package.
    - The **main** element specifies the file that acts as _the entry point_ where NPM is going to install all the dependecies.

> In general this file is generated to manage all the dependencies of the project.
